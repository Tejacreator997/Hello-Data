
1.So initially when I connect the PWD it is connected slash home slash EC2 hyphen user right.

2.The EC2 hyphen user is a user of the particular system.
3. the particular user will be available under the slash USR.
Clear next, moving to.
4.Umm Slash home directory.
5.Home directory.
6.So what is it use of Home directory so user personal data will be stored here users personal data will be stored here.
7.What are the changes are doing by the user during the session when connected to the Linux operating system, the data will be stored on the Slash Home directory.Nexter
8.It is a shared libraries.
9.It is that shared libraries libraries are basically.
Board that executable binary files will be stored.
So like a bin and S bin binaries and super binary files will be stored in this library location.
It's a kind of index.
So this is a library.
Has been.
I told you know, so as bin.
Been both are same but some admin related commands will be executing from this as being normal.
Comments will be running on the normal bin, so basic commands will be running on the bin and the Super administrator commands are running on the spin.
It's a temporary directory temp directory.
Why did you use that fight temporary related storing any files like any software packages we can download and install.
After that we can remove it.
Is that temporary directory.
To store the temporary files to store the temporary files.
So finally we have a that directory.
We have a viaduct.
So that.
So.
The VAD is variable.
Data files will get stored OK.

Under this variable data files, again, we have a subdirectories will be there, log files, log files, temporary files.

These are the three directories are available under the.

But.

What is that log?

Second one is lock.

Hold on this.

Yep.

So these three.

Is available.

Directly under that variable photos.

This is also very, very important.

So what is the use of log file?

Umm so all related the tracking of your data.

What are the changes you are doing?

The changes will be stored in the log 5 so that history will be there.

With that history, we able to reinvestigate and finding the issues log files E LCK files.

Yes.

So this log files OK.

Encrypted information.

Encrypted information pass phrase.

UM Folder Locker written lock executable, lock commands, everything.

They'll be stored in the lock and temporary will be just storing some user during the session to performing the task.

After that, the temporary data will get gone.

So these are the total the directories are in your Linux operating system, their roles and responsibilities, their roles and responsibilities.

You understand?

Any questions here?

So going forward, whatever the services we are installing and configuring, so the complete each and every service and software will be in interacting with these directories and they'll be working and giving an output.

OK, so please go through this file structure Linux file structure.

OK. Couple of times.

OK.
s
And tomorrow we will continue the basic commands, so basic commands.

Nearly 2025 commands are there if you're practicing the 25 commands, that's it.

You can easily manage the Linux operating system in the DevOps, so there's a first level of training in the Linux and the second level of training in that there's a two more sessions we will be automating any kind of job by using the batch scripting.

So the batch scripting I'll take two days after time, so probably that's all made of the class.

So when we are working on the toxic uh task execution on the Docker in this particular area like Split.

So now only operating system related basic commands I'm explaining in the next session tomorrow.

So with that, you're able to easily manage it.

You can able to manage easily.

Any other questions?
